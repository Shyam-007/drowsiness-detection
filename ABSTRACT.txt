ABSTRACT
TOPIC: DROWSINESS DETECTION

The system is basically developed to detect drivers dozing at the wheel at night time driving and long travel. 
The system uses a small infra-red night vision camera that points directly towards the driver‘s face and monitors the driver‘s eyes in order to detect fatigue. 
In such a case when fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver.
This paper discusses the algorithms that have been used to detect drowsiness. 
The decision whether the driver is dozing or not is taken depending on whether 
the eyes are open for a specific number of frames.
If the eyes are found to be closed for a certain number of consecutive frames,
then the driver is alerted with an alarm.
